# What is  Computer Networking?

Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers, servers, and devices so they can communicate, share data, and access resources like the internet, files, printers, and applications.

In simple terms, networking allows devices to talk to each other.
Without networking, there would be no internet, no emails, no cloud, and no communication between systems.

A computer network can be as small as two laptops sharing files in your home, or as large as millions of servers powering global platforms like Google, Netflix, and AWS.

## Why is networking important in DevOps

Networking is the foundation of cloud and DevOps because every application runs on a network.
In DevOps engineering, we will deal with:

- Servers communicating over networks

- Cloud networking (VPCs, subnets, route tables, gateways)

- Load balancers and firewalls

- DNS settings (domain names, records)

- Secure access (SSH, VPN, ports)

- Monitoring network traffic and connectivity

Understanding networking helps in deployment, troubleshooting, security, and scalability of applications in real environments.
