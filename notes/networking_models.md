# 📡 Networking Models Summary

Understanding networking models helps us see **how data travels** across networks. The two main models used in networking are:

- **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection)
- **TCP/IP Model** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

---

## ✅ OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model is a **7-layer framework** that standardizes how systems communicate.  
It breaks networking into clear layers, each responsible for specific tasks.

### **7 Layers of the OSI Model**

| Layer | Name | Purpose / Function | Examples |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
| 7 | **Application Layer** | Provides user-level network services | Web browser, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| 6 | **Presentation Layer** | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3, ASCII |
| 5 | **Session Layer** | Manages sessions and connections | NetBIOS, RPC, SSH sessions |
| 4 | **Transport Layer** | Reliable data delivery, segmentation | TCP, UDP, ports, flow control |
| 3 | **Network Layer** | Routing and IP addressing | IP, ICMP, routers |
| 2 | **Data Link Layer** | Physical addressing (MAC), error detection | MAC address, Ethernet, switches |

## ✅ TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

The TCP/IP model is the **practical model used on the Internet**, created before OSI.  
It explains data flow in **5 layers**.

### **5 Layers of TCP/IP Model**

| Layer | Name | Purpose / Function | Examples |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
| 5 | **Application Layer** | User services and protocols | HTTP, DNS, SSH, SMTP, FTP |
| 4 | **Transport Layer** | End-to-end communication, reliability | TCP, UDP, ports |

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- OSI = **7 layers** (theoretical model)
- TCP/IP = **5 layers** (real-world model)
- Both explain **how data moves** across a network
- DevOps engineers frequently work with:
  - **IP, DNS, HTTP, SSH** (Application)
  - **TCP/UDP & Ports** (Transport)
  - **Routing & subnets** (Network)

---

# 🧠 OSI Model — Application Layer (Layer 7)

The **Application Layer** is the top layer of the OSI model.  
It provides the **interface between user applications and the network**.

This layer does **not** refer to the application itself  
but the **protocols and services applications use to communicate over a network**.

Examples:
- Web browsing
- Email
- File transfer
- Remote login
- DNS resolution

---

## 🌐 Key Protocols in the Application Layer

| Protocol | Purpose | Port | Transport |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) | Web browsing | 80 | TCP |
| **HTTPS** (Secure HTTP) | Secure web browsing (TLS/SSL) | 443 | TCP |
| **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) | File transfer | 21 | TCP |
| **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer) | Secure file transfer | 22 | TCP (SSH) |
| **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) | Sending emails | 25 | TCP |
| **POP3** (Post Office Protocol v3) | Downloading emails | 110 | TCP |
| **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol) | Reading emails on server | 143 | TCP |
| **DNS** (Domain Name System) | Converts domain names to IP | 53 | UDP/TCP |
| **SSH** (Secure Shell) | Secure remote login | 22 | TCP |
| **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) | Assigns IPs | 67/68 | UDP |
| **TELNET** | Remote login (insecure) | 23 | TCP |

---

## 🏛️ Client-Server Architecture

Most network systems follow a **client-server model**.

| Client | Server |
|--------|--------|
| Sends request | Processes requests |
| Consumes data | Stores & serves data |
| Browser, app, CLI | Web server, DB server, mail server |

Example:
- Browser = client
- Web server (Nginx/Apache) = server

---

## 🔁 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

P2P networks **do not require a central server**.  
Devices communicate **directly**.

Examples:
- Torrents
- Blockchain networks (Bitcoin)
- Some chat services

| Client-Server | P2P |
|--------------|-----|
| Central server | No central server |
| Scalable but costly | Highly scalable |
| Single point of failure | No single point failure |

---

## 🖥️ Networking Devices & Their Roles

| Device | Role |
|-------|-----|
| **Router** | Routes packets between networks & assigns IPs |
| **Switch** | Connects devices in a LAN & forwards using MAC |
| **Hub** | Broadcasts to all ports (old tech) |
| **Firewall** | Filters traffic by rules & ports |
| **Modem** | Converts analog ↔ digital internet signal |
| **Access Point** | Provides wireless network access |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes traffic across servers |
| **Gateway** | Connects different network types |

---

## 🔌 How Applications Communicate: Sockets & Ports

### **Sockets**
A socket = `IP address + Port number`

Example:

`192.168.1.10:22 (SSH)`
`10.0.0.5:80 (HTTP)`

### **Ports**
Ports help identify **applications/services** on a device.

| Range | Type |
|------|------|
| 0–1023 | Well-known ports (HTTP 80, SSH 22) |
| 1024–49151 | Registered/ app ports |

- Handles **web, email, DNS, authentication**

---

## Presentation Layer & Session Layer

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is responsible for making data from the application layer readable across different systems. It ensures **formatting, encryption, and compression** of data.

> Think of it as the translator and formatter for network communications.

#### Key Responsibilities
- Data translation (converts formats so systems understand each other)
- Encryption and decryption (secure data transmission)
- Compression and decompression (reduce file size to save bandwidth)
- Character encoding conversion (ASCII, UTF-8, Unicode)

#### Common Standards & Formats

| Category | Examples |
|--------|--------|
Text Encoding | ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 |
Image Formats | JPEG, PNG, GIF |
Video Formats | MP4, AVI |
Encryption Protocols | SSL, TLS |
Serialization Formats | JSON, XML |

#### Real-World Example
When visiting a secure website (HTTPS), this layer encrypts data using **TLS**, protecting passwords, cards, and personal info.

---

### Layer 5: Session Layer

The **Session Layer** manages and controls **sessions** — ongoing communication between two devices. It opens, maintains, and closes dialogs.

> Think of this layer as the "meeting coordinator" for data exchange.

#### Key Responsibilities
| Function | Description |
|--------|-------------|
Session creation | Starts communication between devices |
Session maintenance | Keeps communication active |
Session termination | Cleanly closes session |
Authentication | Confirms identity before communication |
Dialog control | Manages who speaks and when |
Checkpointing | Saves progress to resume transmission if interrupted |

#### Real-World Examples
| Scenario | Session Layer Role |
|---------|-------------------|
Logging into a website | Maintains your login session |
Zoom/Teams call | Keeps call active and synchronized |
File transfer via FTP | Sets checkpoints, resumes if connection drops |

---

### Protocols Seen at These Layers

| Layer | Sample Protocols |
|------|------------------|
Presentation | TLS, SSL, HTTPS, ASCII, UTF-8, JPEG, MPEG |
Session | NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP, SIP, SMB |

---

### Simple Analogy

| Layer | Function | Analogy |
|------|---------|--------|
Presentation | Format, encrypt, compress data | Translator + envelope sealing a letter |
Session | Create, maintain, close connection | Starting, continuing, and ending a phone call |

---

### Summary Table

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|
6 | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption, compression |
5 | Session | Establishes and controls communication sessions |

---

## 🧩 Layer 4: Transport Layer

Welcome to the **Transport Layer** — the **traffic controller** and **delivery service** of networking.

Think of it like a global courier (DHL/UPS):
- Ensures your package (data) goes to the right home (port)
- Decides whether to deliver carefully with receipts + signatures (TCP)
- Or just drop it fast without fuss (UDP)
- Tracks lost packages and resends them (reliability)
- Avoids traffic jams (flow control)

Without this layer, the internet would be chaos — like throwing letters into the air and hoping they land in the right mailbox!

---

### 🎯 What the Transport Layer Does

| Function | Description | Real-Life Analogy |
|---|---|---|
Segmentation | Breaks big data into smaller chunks | Breaking a pizza into slices |
Reassembly | Rebuilds chunks into original data | Putting the pizza back together |
Flow Control | Prevents overwhelming the receiver | Talking slowly so someone taking notes can keep up |
Error Control & Retransmission | Detects lost data, resends | "Did you get that? Let me repeat." |
Connection Control | Establishes & ends communication | Handshake before conversation |
Port Addressing | Directs data to correct app | Apartment numbers in a building |

---

### 🚦 TCP vs UDP — Delivery Styles

| Feature | **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) | **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) |
|---|---|---|
Type | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
Reliability | ✅ Reliable, guaranteed delivery | ❌ No guarantee |
Acknowledgment | Yes | No |
Ordering | Ensures correct order | No ordering |
Speed | Slower (safe & reliable) | Faster (no checks) |
Use Case | Browsing, email, file transfer | Streaming, gaming, VoIP |

#### 📦 Memory Trick

> **TCP = Talk Carefully**  
> **UDP = Ultra-Fast Data Push**

---

### 🤝 TCP Handshake (3-Way Handshake)

TCP sets up a connection first — like a polite conversation:

`Client: SYN → Hey, can we talk?`
`Server: SYN-ACK → Sure, I'm ready!`
`Client: ACK → Great, let’s start!`

Connection is established ✅  
Now real data flows.

---

### 📉 TCP Connection Termination (4-Way Disconnect)

`FIN → Closing now?`
`ACK → Received`
`FIN → Me too.`
`ACK → Bye!`


Like saying goodbye politely instead of hanging up suddenly.

---

### 🎚️ Flow Control & Congestion Control

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|
Windowing | Controls how much data is sent before needing ACK |
Buffering | Temporarily stores incoming data |
Congestion Avoidance | Avoids flooding the network |

---

### 🎮 UDP in Action — Low Latency Wins

UDP sends without waiting — speed over reliability.

Used in:

- 🎮 Online gaming
- 🎥 Video streaming (Netflix, YouTube)
- 📞 Voice calls (Zoom, WhatsApp)
- 📡 DNS queries

> In games, you’d rather skip one frame than freeze!

---

### 🔢 Well-Known Ports (Must-Know!)

| Protocol | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|
HTTP | 80 | Web (unsecured) |
HTTPS | 443 | Secure web |
SSH | 22 | Secure login to servers |
FTP | 20/21 | File transfers |
DNS | 53 | Translates domain to IP |
SMTP | 25 | Send email |
IMAP | 143 | Receive email |
POP3 | 110 | Download email |
DHCP | 67/68 | Gives IP addresses |
DNS | 53 | Name resolution |

| Feature | TCP | UDP |
|---|---|---|
Connection | Required | None |
Reliability | High | Low |
Speed | Slower | Very fast |
Order | Guaranteed | Not guaranteed |
