# 📡 Networking Models Summary

Understanding networking models helps us see **how data travels** across networks. The two main models used in networking are:

- **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection)
- **TCP/IP Model** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

---

## ✅ OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model is a **7-layer framework** that standardizes how systems communicate.  
It breaks networking into clear layers, each responsible for specific tasks.

### **7 Layers of the OSI Model**

| Layer | Name | Purpose / Function | Examples |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
| 7 | **Application Layer** | Provides user-level network services | Web browser, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| 6 | **Presentation Layer** | Data translation, encryption, compression | SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3, ASCII |
| 5 | **Session Layer** | Manages sessions and connections | NetBIOS, RPC, SSH sessions |
| 4 | **Transport Layer** | Reliable data delivery, segmentation | TCP, UDP, ports, flow control |
| 3 | **Network Layer** | Routing and IP addressing | IP, ICMP, routers |
| 2 | **Data Link Layer** | Physical addressing (MAC), error detection | MAC address, Ethernet, switches |
| 1 | **Physical Layer** | Transmission of raw bits over media | Cables, Wi-Fi, voltages, hubs |

## ✅ TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

The TCP/IP model is the **practical model used on the Internet**, created before OSI.  
It explains data flow in **5 layers**.

### **5 Layers of TCP/IP Model**

| Layer | Name | Purpose / Function | Examples |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
| 5 | **Application Layer** | User services and protocols | HTTP, DNS, SSH, SMTP, FTP |
| 4 | **Transport Layer** | End-to-end communication, reliability | TCP, UDP, ports |
| 3 | **Network Layer** | Logical addressing and routing | IP, ICMP, routers |
| 2 | **Data Link Layer** | MAC addressing, framing | Ethernet, switches, ARP |
| 1 | **Physical Layer** | Physical media and signals | Cables, NIC, Wi-Fi, fiber |

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- OSI = **7 layers** (theoretical model)
- TCP/IP = **5 layers** (real-world model)
- Both explain **how data moves** across a network
- DevOps engineers frequently work with:
  - **IP, DNS, HTTP, SSH** (Application)
  - **TCP/UDP & Ports** (Transport)
  - **Routing & subnets** (Network)
  - **Ethernet, MAC, Wi-Fi** (Data Link / Physical)

---

# 🧠 Application Layer (Layer 7)

The **Application Layer** is the top layer of the OSI model.  
It provides the **interface between user applications and the network**.

This layer does **not** refer to the application itself  
but the **protocols and services applications use to communicate over a network**.

Examples:
- Web browsing
- Email
- File transfer
- Remote login
- DNS resolution

---

## 🌐 Key Protocols in the Application Layer

| Protocol | Purpose | Port | Transport |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) | Web browsing | 80 | TCP |
| **HTTPS** (Secure HTTP) | Secure web browsing (TLS/SSL) | 443 | TCP |
| **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) | File transfer | 21 | TCP |
| **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer) | Secure file transfer | 22 | TCP (SSH) |
| **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) | Sending emails | 25 | TCP |
| **POP3** (Post Office Protocol v3) | Downloading emails | 110 | TCP |
| **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol) | Reading emails on server | 143 | TCP |
| **DNS** (Domain Name System) | Converts domain names to IP | 53 | UDP/TCP |
| **SSH** (Secure Shell) | Secure remote login | 22 | TCP |
| **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) | Assigns IPs | 67/68 | UDP |
| **TELNET** | Remote login (insecure) | 23 | TCP |

---

## 🏛️ Client-Server Architecture

Most network systems follow a **client-server model**.

| Client | Server |
|--------|--------|
| Sends request | Processes requests |
| Consumes data | Stores & serves data |
| Browser, app, CLI | Web server, DB server, mail server |

Example:
- Browser = client
- Web server (Nginx/Apache) = server

---

## 🔁 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

P2P networks **do not require a central server**.  
Devices communicate **directly**.

Examples:
- Torrents
- Blockchain networks (Bitcoin)
- Some chat services

| Client-Server | P2P |
|--------------|-----|
| Central server | No central server |
| Scalable but costly | Highly scalable |
| Single point of failure | No single point failure |

---

## 🖥️ Networking Devices & Their Roles

| Device | Role |
|-------|-----|
| **Router** | Routes packets between networks & assigns IPs |
| **Switch** | Connects devices in a LAN & forwards using MAC |
| **Hub** | Broadcasts to all ports (old tech) |
| **Firewall** | Filters traffic by rules & ports |
| **Modem** | Converts analog ↔ digital internet signal |
| **Access Point** | Provides wireless network access |
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes traffic across servers |
| **Gateway** | Connects different network types |

---

## 🔌 How Applications Communicate: Sockets & Ports

### **Sockets**
A socket = `IP address + Port number`

Example:

`192.168.1.10:22 (SSH)`
`10.0.0.5:80 (HTTP)`

### **Ports**
Ports help identify **applications/services** on a device.

| Range | Type |
|------|------|
| 0–1023 | Well-known ports (HTTP 80, SSH 22) |
| 1024–49151 | Registered/ app ports |
| 49152–65535 | Private/ dynamic ports |

---

## 🌍 HTTP — Web Communication Protocol

|--------|--------|------|
Send email | SMTP | 25 |
Receive email | POP3 | 110 |
Read email from server | IMAP | 143 |

### **Flow Example**

1. User sends email → SMTP server
2. SMTP forwards to recipient’s mail server
3. Recipient retrieves via POP3/IMAP

---

## 🌐 DNS — Domain Name System

DNS converts **domain names → IP addresses**

Example:

`google.com → 142.250.64.78`


### DNS Record Types

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **A** | Domain → IPv4 |
| **AAAA** | Domain → IPv6 |
| **CNAME** | Alias domain |
| **MX** | Mail server |
| **TXT** | Verification / security |
| **NS** | Name servers |

### DNS Tools
- `nslookup`
- `dig`
- `host`

---

- Handles **web, email, DNS, authentication**

---

# Presentation Layer & Session Layer

## Layer 6: Presentation Layer

The **Presentation Layer** is responsible for making data from the application layer readable across different systems. It ensures **formatting, encryption, and compression** of data.

> Think of it as the translator and formatter for network communications.

#### Key Responsibilities
- Data translation (converts formats so systems understand each other)
- Encryption and decryption (secure data transmission)
- Compression and decompression (reduce file size to save bandwidth)
- Character encoding conversion (ASCII, UTF-8, Unicode)

#### Common Standards & Formats

|--------|--------|
Text Encoding | ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 |
Image Formats | JPEG, PNG, GIF |
Video Formats | MP4, AVI |
Encryption Protocols | SSL, TLS |
Serialization Formats | JSON, XML |

#### Real-World Example
When visiting a secure website (HTTPS), this layer encrypts data using **TLS**, protecting passwords, cards, and personal info.

---

## Layer 5: Session Layer

The **Session Layer** manages and controls **sessions** — ongoing communication between two devices. It opens, maintains, and closes dialogs.

> Think of this layer as the "meeting coordinator" for data exchange.

#### Key Responsibilities
| Function | Description |
|--------|-------------|
Session creation | Starts communication between devices |
Session maintenance | Keeps communication active |
Session termination | Cleanly closes session |
Authentication | Confirms identity before communication |
Dialog control | Manages who speaks and when |
Checkpointing | Saves progress to resume transmission if interrupted |

#### Real-World Examples
| Scenario | Session Layer Role |
|---------|-------------------|
Logging into a website | Maintains your login session |
Zoom/Teams call | Keeps call active and synchronized |
File transfer via FTP | Sets checkpoints, resumes if connection drops |

---

### Protocols Seen at These Layers

| Layer | Sample Protocols |
|------|------------------|
Presentation | TLS, SSL, HTTPS, ASCII, UTF-8, JPEG, MPEG |
Session | NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP, SIP, SMB |

---

### Simple Analogy

| Layer | Function | Analogy |
|------|---------|--------|
Presentation | Format, encrypt, compress data | Translator + envelope sealing a letter |
Session | Create, maintain, close connection | Starting, continuing, and ending a phone call |

---

### Summary Table

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|--------|
6 | Presentation | Data formatting, encryption, compression |
5 | Session | Establishes and controls communication sessions |

# 🧩 Layer 4: Transport Layer

Welcome to the **Transport Layer** — the **traffic controller** and **delivery service** of networking.

Think of it like a global courier (DHL/UPS):
- Ensures your package (data) goes to the right home (port)
- Decides whether to deliver carefully with receipts + signatures (TCP)
- Or just drop it fast without fuss (UDP)
- Tracks lost packages and resends them (reliability)
- Avoids traffic jams (flow control)

Without this layer, the internet would be chaos — like throwing letters into the air and hoping they land in the right mailbox!

> Note that transport layer is easily confused with Network layer. Below is table that differentiate their jobs.

## 🚚 Transport Layer vs 🌐 Network Layer

| Feature                | **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**                               | **Network Layer (Layer 3)**                    |

| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Transport = T for Talking between applications** | It manages the *conversation* |
| **Network = N for Navigating networks**            | It manages the *path/route*   |


---

### 🎯 What the Transport Layer Does - Deep dive with fun analogies

| Function | Description | Real-Life Analogy |
|---|---|---|
Segmentation | Breaks big data into smaller chunks | Breaking a pizza into slices |
Reassembly | Rebuilds chunks into original data | Putting the pizza back together |
Flow Control | Prevents overwhelming the receiver | Talking slowly so someone taking notes can keep up |

|---|---|---|
Type | Connection-oriented | Connectionless |
Reliability | ✅ Reliable, guaranteed delivery | ❌ No guarantee |
Acknowledgment | Yes | No |
Ordering | Ensures correct order | No ordering |
Speed | Slower (safe & reliable) | Faster (no checks) |
Use Case | Browsing, email, file transfer | Streaming, gaming, VoIP |

#### 📦 Memory Trick

> **TCP = Talk Carefully**  
> **UDP = Ultra-Fast Data Push**

---

## Connection flow in TCP

Connection is controlled by **Timers**, and the packets of data sent are traced using the sequence number. With this kind of back and forth communication, the data is traced and timed and errors and omitted! Cool!

`sudo tcpdump -c 5` - this command shows you the number of packets coming in, in this case, `5` being the number packets I have set to recieve. 

### 🤝 TCP Handshake (3-Way Handshake)

TCP sets up a connection first — like a polite conversation:

`Client: SYN → Hey, can we talk?` - Synchronisation flag + Sequence number
`Server: SYN-ACK → Sure, I'm ready!` Synchronisation flag + Server Acknowlegemnt Number.
`Client: ACK → Great, let’s start!` Acknowlegement (number +1)

Connection is established ✅  
Now real data flows.

---

### 📉 TCP Connection Termination (4-Way Disconnect)

`FIN → Closing now?`
`ACK → Received`
`FIN → Me too.`
`ACK → Bye!`


Like saying goodbye politely instead of hanging up suddenly.

---

### 🎚️ Flow Control & Congestion Control

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|
Windowing | Controls how much data is sent before needing ACK |
Buffering | Temporarily stores incoming data |
Congestion Avoidance | Avoids flooding the network |

---

## 🎮 UDP in Action — Low Latency Wins

Components of a UDP packet:

- Source and Destination Port numbers.
- Length of datagram.
- Checksum.

UDP sends without waiting, speed over reliability.

Used in:

- 🎮 Online gaming
- 🎥 Video streaming (Netflix, YouTube)
- 📞 Voice calls (Zoom, WhatsApp)
- 📡 DNS queries

> In games, you’d rather skip one frame than freeze!

### 🔢 Well-Known Ports (Must-Know!)

| Protocol | Port | Notes |
|---|---|---|
HTTP | 80 | Web (unsecured) |
HTTPS | 443 | Secure web |
SSH | 22 | Secure login to servers |
FTP | 20/21 | File transfers |
DNS | 53 | Translates domain to IP |

### 🏁 Quick Memory Cheat-Codes

- **TCP** = Reliable, ordered, handshake
- **UDP** = Fast, lightweight, no guarantee
- **Ports** = App entry doors
- **Transport Layer = Data delivery boss**

---

### ✅ Why  as DevOps Engineers  we should Care

- Load balancers route TCP/UDP traffic
- Kubernetes services use ports & protocols
- Firewalls, security groups, NACLs operate on ports
- Debugging connectivity issues requires TCP/UDP knowledge
- DNS, SSH, HTTPS — all transport layer use cases

> If we can troubleshoot ports & protocols, we can troubleshoot the cloud.

# 🌐 Network, Data-Link, and Physical layers

These are the **foundation levels** of the OSI model — where IP addresses, MAC addresses, routers, switches, cables, and electricity all come alive.

These layers decide **where data goes**, **how it travels**, and **what format it takes on the wire**.

---

## 3️⃣ Network Layer (Layer 3)

The **Network Layer** handles **routing**, **logical addressing**, and **path selection**.

> Think of this layer as **Google Maps for your data** — deciding the best route across the internet.

**Control Plane**:  This is where the Routers tables lie. Routers are nodes and the links between are the Egdes. Routers create a sort of maps or graphs that are connected.

### 🧠 Core Responsibilities

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
Logical addressing | Assigns IP addresses to devices |
Routing (Routing Table) | Chooses best path across networks |
Packet forwarding | Moves data from router to router |
Fragmentation | Breaks large packets if needed |

---

### 🧾 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
IP Address | Logical device address (like a street address) |
Router | Device that forwards packets between networks |
Subnetting | Dividing a network into smaller networks |
NAT | Allows many devices to share one public IP |
ICMP | Used for troubleshooting (ping) |

---

IPSec | Secure IP traffic |

---

### 🌍 Real-World Examples
- Visiting a website (uses IP + routing)
- Sending messages across countries
- Cloud VPC routing in AWS, Azure, GCP

> If TCP is the postman, **IP is the address written on the envelope**.

---

## 2️⃣ Data-Link Layer (Layer 2)

The **Data-Link Layer** provides **node-to-node delivery** inside the same local network (LAN). DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) servers are the point of contact for new devices to get allocated a new IP address. Data link layer Address of sender and IP address of destination are part the shoe kinking process.

> Think of it as **the rulebook for neighbors talking over the fence**.

---

### 🧠 Core Responsibilities

| Task | Explanation |
|---|---|
MAC addressing | Physical address burned into NIC |
Frames | Data formatting for LAN transmission |
Error checking | Detects transmission errors |
Flow control | Prevents overwhelming devices |
Switching | Forwards frames inside the LAN |

---

### 🧾 Sub-Layers

| Sub-Layer | Role |
|---|---|
LLC (Logical Link Control) | Identifies protocols, error control |
MAC (Media Access Control) | Uses MAC addresses, controls access |

---

### 🔌 Devices & Protocols

| Device / Protocol | Role |
|---|---|
Switch | Forwards frames in LAN using MAC |
Bridge | Connects LAN segments |

Wi-Fi (802.11) | Wireless LAN |

---

### 🍪 MAC Address Example

`D4-3B-04-9A-2C-F1`

Like a device fingerprint — **unique, permanent, cannot be shared**.

---

### ⚡ Fun Memory Tip

> **Layer 2 = Switching + MAC + LAN**

When troubleshooting local network issues — think Layer 2 first.

---

## 1️⃣ Physical Layer (Layer 1)

The **Physical Layer** is the **hardware and electrical world** — it moves **bits** (0s and 1s) across cables and signals.

> Imagine being inside the cable hearing electrons and light fibers shouting “ONE! ZERO! ZERO! ONE!” 😆

---

### 🧠 Core Responsibilities

| Task | Meaning |
|---|---|
Bit transmission | Sends raw bits across media |
Electrical / Optical standards | Voltage, light wave standards |
